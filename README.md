# GCP-Notes
# In this repo, I have documented some GCP setups I have frequently used. The following is the list:

1. TF-SL-MUJEFA: This is a 3rd party customized VM called 'MUJEFA'. MUJEFA comes with preinstalled python based AI/ML frameworks like NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib etc. to name a few. In addition, MUJEFA comes with other useful tools & goodies like:
	1. Remote desktop
	2. Working demos based on the popular book “Python Machine Learning, 2nd Ed“  By Raschka, Sebastian & Vahid Mirjalili .
	3. Fish , a Linux shell with command auto completion & auto suggestion features
	4. Visual studio code IDE for development
